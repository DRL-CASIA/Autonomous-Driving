1. Introduction
---------------
First a big welcome, I hope you will enjoy your ride:-)

This is an all in one package of TORCS. Be aware that some included
artwork has non free (in the GPL sense) licenses, you will find a "readme.txt"
in those directories. The rest is either licensed under the GPL or the Free
Art License. If you want to create cars or advanced tracks using the accc tool,
you will require stripe from http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~stripe.

If you use TORCS for research/projects you can have a look into the FAQ for
citation guidelines.

Kind regards

Bernhard


2. Documentation
----------------
You can find a variety of links on www.torcs.org (video tutorials about content
creation/usage, written documentation like the robot tutorial, etc.). The TORCS
API and architecture documentation can be generated with Doxygen 1.8, run
"make doc", the result can be found in doc/manual/api, point to index.html.


3. Non-Free content (in GPL sense)
----------------------------------
Here the list with the directories containing non free content, look at the
readme.txt for details:
- data/cars/models/pw-*
- data/cars/models/kc-*


4. Track editor
---------------
The track editor is not included in this distribution, you can get it from
http://www.berniw.org/trb/download/trackeditor-0.6.2c.tar.bz2, the sources
are included in the jar. The sources are also available here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/trackeditor.


5. Linux Installation from Source
---------------------------------
- Requires plib 1.8.5, FreeGLUT or GLUT, be aware to compile plib with -fPIC
  on AMD64 if you run a 64 bit version of Linux. Be aware that maybe just
  1.8.5 works.
- Untar the archive
- cd into the torcs-1.3.5 directory
- ./configure (use --help for showing the options, of interest might be
  --enable-debug and --disable-xrandr).
- make
- make install
- make datainstall
- start with "torcs"

Command line arguments:
* -l list the dynamically linked libraries
* -d run under gdb and print stack trace on exit, makes most sense when compiled
     with --enable-debug
* -g run under Valgrind (requires a debug build for useful results)
* -e display the commands to issue when you want to run under gdb
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -m use X mouse cursor and do not hide it during races
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details
* -k (keep) suppress calls to dlclose to keep modules loaded (for Valgrind runs,
     to avoid "??" in the call stack)


6. Windows Installation from Source (Release version)
-----------------------------------------------------
- hint: you can have a release and a debug build side by side, the release
  version goes to "runtime" and the debug to "runtimed".
- requires VS 6 (tested with sp6) or VS 2008 (tested with sp1), VS2010 is reported
  to work as well. For express editions or VS 2012 read notes in section 6.1.
- VS 6.0 support is fading out, you will need to install the Windows Server 2003
  February Edtion CORE SDK (the last one which worked with VS 6.0) and set the lib
  and include path in the options (used for SHGetFolderPath etc.).
- untar the archive into a path without whitespaces and special characters.
- cd into the torcs-1.3.5 directory
- run setup_win32.bat
- run setup_win32-data-from-CVS.bat
- select the TORCS workspace (TORCS.dsw for VS 6) or solution (TORCS.sln
  for VS 2008), select the w32-Release version.
- compile project (0 warnings)
- cd into the "runtime" directory.
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Command line arguments:
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details 


6.1 Windows Installation from Source, additional notes
------------------------------------------------------
6.1.1 VS 2005 Express (based on imported dsw), reported by Eric Espie:
- Run up to the setup*.bat step in the above instructions, then open the TORCS.dsw
  file and do the following changes
- in wtorcs -> Source Files (Solution explorer) exclude torcs.rc
- in client -> Source Files add the file errno.cpp to the solution (located
  in src/libs/client)
- change in the properties of all the sub-projects :
        in "Configuration Properties -> Link Editor -> Entry : Ignore Specific Library"
        change LIBCD in LIBC if present.

6.1.2 VS 2005 Express (based on VS2008 sln), reported by Wolf-Dieter Beelitz:
- Edit all vcproj (=xml) files and set the "version" from 9.00 to 8.00
- Follow the instructions above.

6.1.3 VS 2008 Express, reported by Stacey Pritchett:
- in wtorcs -> Source Files (Solution explorer) exclude torcs.rc
- Follow the instructions above.

6.1.4 VS 2012, reported by SteveO:
- In every project (except TORCS) add /SAFESEH:NO into the Additional Options
  (Properties-Configuration Properties-Linker-Command Line), see also
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a89h429.aspx.


7. Windows Installation from Source (Debug version)
---------------------------------------------------
- hint: you can have a debug and a release build side by side, the debug
  version goes to "runtimed" and the release to "runtime".
- requires VS 6 (tested with sp6) or VS 2008 (tested with sp1), VS2010 is reported
  to work as well. For express editions or VS 2012 read notes in section 6.1.
- VS 6.0 support is fading out, you will need to install the Windows Server 2003
  February Edtion CORE SDK (the last one which worked with VS 6.0) and set the lib
  and include path in the options (used for SHGetFolderPath etc.).
- untar the archive into a path without whitespaces and special characters.
- cd into the torcs-1.3.5 directory
- run setup_win32_debug.bat
- run setup_win32-data-from-CVS_debug.bat
- select the TORCS workspace (TORCS.dsw for VS 6) or solution (TORCS.sln
  for VS 2008), select the w32-Debug version
- compile project (0 warnings)
- cd into the "runtimed" directory.
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Command line arguments:
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details 


8. Testing
----------
If you find problems which should be already fixed or new ones please report them
to the torcs-users mailing list.


9. Getting Help
---------------
During the game press F1. For more in depth information visit www.torcs.org,
you find there a lot of information, look at the documentation section on
the left, have as well a look into the list of howto's. If you are stuck
have a look into the FAQ to learn how and where to report a problem.


10. Running under Valgrind with Linux
------------------------------------
First you need to build a debug version of TORCS, make sure that the CFLAGS,
CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables are empty (usually they are). Then
run "make distclean", then the configure script with the option --enable-debug
and all other options which you require, build and install as usual.

To find memory leaks run first (Valgrind must be available in the path):
./torcs -g

You will find the logfile valgrind.log in the .torcs directory. If you have
"??" in the call stack, you can run TORCS with the -k option to avoid unloading
the modules:
./torcs -g -k

You should use -k just to investigate the "??" in the call stacks, because the
suppression of dlclose can hide problems related with module release and cause
problems because modules are just recycled but not reloaded.

Of course you can use this with the console (command line) mode as well, e.g.:
./torcs -g -r ~/.torcs/config/raceman/champ.xml
./torcs -g -k -r ~/.torcs/config/raceman/dtmrace.xml

Some additional notes:
- Valgrind (version 3.6.1) reports on systems with the ATI flgrx OpenGL driver (8.961)
  lots of leaks, according AMD Valgrind misinterprets memory blocks handed over to the
  kernel. When I wrote suppressions the flgrx driver hung the X Server up, conclusion:
  Give it a try (maybe another Valgrind/driver/kernel combination does/will do better),
  but if you run in the mentioned problems, just use the TORCS command line mode or
  install temporarily the Open Source ATI driver alternative, maybe this does do better
  (not tested, send me a report;-) )
- You can edit the "torcs" script and add "--leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes"
  to see what is still reachable at exit. This is useful to reduce the amount of cached
  xml file handles or hunt down missing releases of handles (they are not reported
  usually because they are reachable via the cache), beware, it is perfectly
  fine that the GUI and some handles are held permanent.

  custom racemanagers or running custom batches with -r (Bernhard).
- Improved -r on Windows, paths containing backslashes ('\') are now working
  (Bernhard). 
- Added ShFolder.lib to VS 6 project files (required for SHGetFolderPath).

  input devices which fire button and axis events on analogue buttons, e.g.
  L2/R2 of playstation 4 controllers. Add in the drivers section of
  preferences.xml e.g. <attstr name="blacklisted events" val="BTN7-0,BTN8-0"/>
  (Bernhard).
- Improved wheel velocity calculation (Bernhard).
- Improved suspension code to catch damping spikes in extreme conditions and
  setups, for TRB (Wolf-Dieter, Bernhard).
- Added comments in susp.cpp (Bernhard).
